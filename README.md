# Gemini Obsidian

Simple plugin for editing your text with Gemini. After enabling the plugin, add your API key to the settings.

## Getting started
1. Add your gemini API key in the plugin settings. 
2. Run the command `gemini-generate` from the command pallete (consider mapping this to a keyboard shortcut).
3. The highlighted text plus a user optional prompt will be sent to Gemini and the result will be pasted back in the editor.
